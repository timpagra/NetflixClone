Netflix Clone

FE Features

1. We need a sidebar that lists the categories of the movies we have available
2. The canvas on the right will render the list of movies in selected genre
3. Fetch and render the list of movies by the selected genre (later be able to sort and - support infinite scrolling)
4. The canvas that displays the list of movies will be displayed in a gallery fashion which is selectable. 
5. The dialog will pop up upon clicking a movie and that will display deatails about the selected movie (actors, etc)
6. We create a guest session to interact with the API and later implement a user session
7. There should be a search feature to display the results of a search query. The results will be displayed in a similar fashion to what the canvas for the genre search displays.
8. Make a client module to handle data fetching. 

Technologies
1. React Typescript
